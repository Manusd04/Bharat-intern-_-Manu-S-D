# Internship Projects

This repository contains two projects completed during my internship with Bharat-intern. Below are details about each project:

## Iris Flowers Prediction

The first project focuses on predicting the varieties of flowers based on the length of their petals and sepals.

### Introduction

The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model that could classify different varieties of iris flowers using only the length measurements of their petals and sepals. This task falls under the domain of machine learning and classification.

### Project Highlights

- Utilized the [Iris Flowers dataset](link-to-dataset) containing petal and sepal length measurements.
- Built and trained a machine learning model for flower species classification.
- Evaluated the model's performance in terms of accuracy and precision.

### How to Use

Provide instructions on how to use or run the project, if applicable.

### Data

The dataset used in this project is available in this repository. You can access it [here](link-to-iris-dataset).

### Acknowledgments

Thank you to Bharat-intern for providing the opportunity to work on this project.

## Wine Quality Prediction

The second project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on various features.

### Introduction

In this project, the goal was to build a predictive model that could assess the quality of wine based on factors such as acidity, sweetness, and more. Wine quality assessment is a common task in the field of data analysis and machine learning.

### Project Highlights

- Utilized the [Wine Quality dataset]([https://github.com/Manusd04/Bharat-intern-_-Manu-S-D/blob/main/wine/winequality.csv]) containing various wine attributes and quality ratings.
- Developed and trained a machine learning model for wine quality prediction.
- Evaluated the model's accuracy and precision in predicting wine quality.

### How to Use

Provide instructions on how to use or run the project, if applicable.

### Data
